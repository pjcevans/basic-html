				<p>Web development has been an interest of mine for some time, as a hobby I enjoy learning about new technologies, running through tutorials and then building on where they finish.</p>
				<p>I now want to push my long term hobby interest in coding into a primary position in my life, giving it the attention it deserves so I can finish projects, work as part of a team, and be a part of building effective and beautiful systems.</p>
				<p>Below is a breakdown of some of the areas I have explored while developing my interest in development.</p>

			<h3>Python</h3>
			<p>I have used python to explore the fundamentals of object oriented programming, I enjoy its clean intuitive style and the importance placed on use of whitespace.</p>
		</article>

		<article>
			<img src="assets/images/ruby-logo.png">
			<h3>Ruby</h3>
			<p>I've used Ruby to write some basic web scrapers and as part of implementing Rails applications. I would like to work with Ruby in much more depth, both standalone and in conjunction with Rails.</p>
		</article>

		<article>
			<img src="assets/images/c-logo.png">
			<h3>C</h3>
			<p>I studied C to a basic level in order to learn the fundamentals of programming.	 I've found other languages more intuitive and engaging since but enjoyed touching on pointers and bitwise operations, which I have yet to do since.</p>
		</article>

		<article>
			<img src="assets/images/angular-logo.png">
			<h3>Angular</h3>
			<p>I completed a tutorial which implemented an Angular front-end on a rails back-end (serving JSON, asset pipeline disabled). I found this to be very enjoyable as I love the idea of effective single page applications</p>
		</article>


		<article>
			<img src="assets/images/heroku-logo.png">
			<h3>Heroku</h3>
			<p>I think Heroku is great, I love the way hardware capacity is abstracted into "dynos". I've deployed using Heroku while taking my first steps with Rails.</p>
		</article>

		<article>
			<img src="assets/images/rails-logo.png">
			<h3>Rails</h3>
			<p>I have been interacting with Rails for some time as part of work but have recently started expanding on tutorials to develop a familiarity with Rails. My most recent success has been re-writing migrations to be able to deploy an app where I had manually modified the db during development.</p>
		</article>

		<article>
			<img src="assets/images/django-logo.png">
			<h3>Django</h3>
			<p>I worked on the tutorials included in the Django documentation when I was first starting to find out about back-end development. Though I didn't progress far with Django I did learn the basics of MVC.</p>
		</article>

		<article>
			<img src="assets/images/html-logo.png">
			<h3>HTML</h3>
			<p>I first started building websites for fun using just HTML and CSS, I enjoy working with the Document Object Model using HTML.</p>
		</article>

		<article>
			<img src="assets/images/css-logo.png">
			<h3>CSS</h3>
			<p>I enjoy working with CSS and have enjoyed focussing on optimisation in the past. I've experimented with transitions for the first time in making this site and am looking forward to becoming adept in newer CSS capabilities.</p>
		</article>

		<article>
			<img src="assets/images/bootstrap-logo.png">
			<h3>Twitter Bootstrap</h3>
			<p>Though I've not used it here as I thought it appropriate to work from scratch I've worked through the Bootstrap documentation before as I think relying on a framework for common optimisations and design patterns could be very useful in certain situations</p>
		</article>

		<article>
			<img src="assets/images/wordpress-logo.png">
			<h3>Wordpress</h3>
			<p>I have built a few websites with Wordpress, the only one currently live is <a href="http://worldeducationalfilms.com/">worldeducationalfilms.com</a> - Reaching the extent of what was possible with customising Wordpress templates was what led me to spend more time understanding web back-end.</p>
